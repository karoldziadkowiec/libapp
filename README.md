# libapp
The project is a modern window application that acts as an interface for effective library management. This project perfectly illustrates how modern information technologies can significantly improve processes related to customer service. The application has been designed to enable the librarian to run the library in an effective way and to facilitate access to information about both books and readers. Thanks to the graphical interface, the application is easy to use, which increases the efficiency of the librarian's work.
